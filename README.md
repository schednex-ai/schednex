A custom Kubernetes scheduler that uses insights from K8sGPT, powered by AI. 
Enabling the smartest placement of your workloads.

## How it works

_Imagine your scheduler reacting to dynamic information from your cluster._

Schednex is a Kubernetes scheduler that uses insights from K8sGPT to make intelligent decisions about where to place your workloads. It uses the K8sGPT API to get recommendations for the best node to place a pod based on the pod's requirements and the current state of the cluster.
If it cannot make the decision in a timely fashion it will failover to the default scheduler.
Information from K8sGPT analyzers and cluster telemetry is used to decide where placement is best for new pods.

## Requirements

- k8sgpt-operator installed with a deployed K8sGPT custom resource
  - k8sgpt resource must have AI enabled and using the `openai` backend
  - **K8sGPT v0.3.41 and later**
  - Disable caching `noCache: true` within the K8sGPT CR
- Metrics Server installed in the cluster:
  - `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml`

## Installation
- Install K8sGPT operator with [this guide](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

- Install the scheduler:
```
  helm repo add schednex-ai https://charts.schednex.ai
helm repo update
helm install schednex-scheduler schednex-ai/schednex -n kube-system
```
